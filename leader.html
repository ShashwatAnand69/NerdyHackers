    <p class="p1">What is leadership?</p>
    <p class="p2">Effective leadership is not unique to iconic figures like Martin Luther King Jr. or Mahatma
        Gandhi, who paved the way for a better tomorrow.
        For instance, when I think of leaders and leadership, I also think of nurses who work
        tirelessly to care for our sick and elderly, artists who lend their creativity to challenge the way
        we think, and community members who stand up to protest for social change.
        </p>
        <p class="p2">Leaders help foster new ideas and growth within their communities. The truth is that there’s
            a leader in each of us.
            But let’s start by breaking down the idea of leadership. On its most basic level, leadership is
            defined as the capacity to lead and generate a following.</p>
            <p class="p1">Why is leadership skills important?</p>
            <p class="p2">Whether you are in college or entering the working world, there will be situations that require
                you to step up as a leader.
                Even outside of your career, there are moments in life where you may depend on your
                leadership skills to uplift those around you.
                </p>
    <p class="p2">Let’s take a look at how you can develop your leadership skills while answering the burning
        question: why is leadership important?</p>
        <p class="p1">How to improve leadership skills?</p>
        <p class="p3">Be disciplined
        </p>
        <p class="p2">A good leader needs discipline. Developing discipline in your professional (and personal) life
            is a must to be an effective leader and inspire others to be disciplined as well.
            Demonstrate discipline at work by always meeting deadlines, keeping appointments, and
            ending meetings on time.

                </p>
        <p class="p3">Develop situational awareness
        </p>
        <p class="p2">A good leader is someone who can see the bigger picture and anticipate problems before
            they occur.
            This is a valuable skill to have when handling complex projects with tight deadlines. The
            ability to foresee and provide suggestions for avoiding potential problems is invaluable for a
            leader.
            </p>
            <p class="p2">This ability also helps you recognize opportunities that others overlook, which will certainly
                earn you recognition. This can be especially difficult to develop when leading remote teams,
                but with practice, you can become more attuned to your teams and projects.</p>
                <p class="p3">Take on more responsibilities
                </p>
                <p class="p2">A leader means being responsible for others as well as yourself. Asking to receive more
                    responsibilities at work is a great way of preparing yourself for the increased sense of
                    responsibility that you will have once you become a leader</p>
                    <p class="p2">Also, by showing your ability to take on more responsibility, you can convince your
                        employers that you would be a suitable choice for future job promotions.</p>
        <p class="p3">Positivity</p>
        <P class="p2">A positive attitude can go a long way in an office. You should be able to laugh at yourself
            when something doesn't go quite as planned; this helps create a happy and healthy work
            environment, even during busy, stressful periods.
            </P>
            <p class="p3">Learn to listen
            </p>
            <p class="p2">It is the sign of a good leader to listen to other people as a means of learning new things and
                improving the work environment. A good leader is open to hearing feedback, criticism, and
                suggestions from their team members. This helps them to learn from their past errors.</p>
                <p class="p3">Inspire others
                </p>
                <p class="p2">Being a leader means you are part of a team, and as a leader, you should be able to
                    motivate and inspire those you work with to collaborate as best they can. When a team
                    member needs encouragement or guidance, offer it. Sometimes, all a person needs is
                    someone to listen and be sympathetic.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p3">Empowering your teammates
                        <p class="p2">No one is the best at everything, and the sooner you realise that, the sooner you can learn to
                            be a good leader. Delegating tasks to others not only frees you up for things you do well, but
                            it also empowers other people on your team</p>
        <p class="p3">Keep learning
        </p>
        <p class="p2">The best path to becoming a good leader is to be open to learning new things. It keeps your
            mind sharp and your skills fresh. It primes you for new challenges that may come your way,
            which is always a good thing for a leader.</p>
