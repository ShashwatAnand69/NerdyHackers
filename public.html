<p class="p1">What Is Public Speaking?</p>
<p class="p2">Public speaking is a soft skill that requires excellent communication skills, enthusiasm, and
    the ability to engage with an audience. Soft skills are interpersonal skills that are less
    technical and more about how you interact with others.
    </p>
    <p class="p2">Public speakers make presentations to a group. Presentations could range from speaking to
        a small number of employees to presenting to a large audience at a national conference or
        event.</p>
        <img class="pub-2" src="images/public2.png" alt="">
        <p class="p1">Why is public speaking skill important?
        </p>
        <p class="p2">In both college and your career, strong public speaking skills will set you apart, make you
            feel more confident, and give you the ability to take on leadership roles.</p>
            <p class="p2">Public speaking offers one of the most effective ways to get your point across, demonstrate
                your knowledge, and influence others.</p>
                <p class="p2">It can even help you stay organized and improve your writing and interpersonal
                    communication.</p>
                    <P class="p1">How to improve public speaking skill?</P>
                    <p class="p3">Relax Your Body Language</p>
                    <p class="p2">A fear of public speaking can make you feel tense, which negatively affects your body
                        language. The best public speakers maintain proper posture, make eye contact with the
                        audience, and move in ways that look natural.</p>
                        <p class="p2">Good body language improves your performance and helps the audience take in and
                            remember what you say. Avoid putting your hands in your pockets or crossing your arms. Instead, start with your arms
                            at your side and use purposeful hand gestures as you make your points.</p>
    <p class="p2">Look out into the audience. Don't stare down at the ground or at your notes for long periods
        of time.
        As you build confidence, you may even start to make eye contact with individual people
        watching your presentation.</p>
        <p class="p3">Study about good public speakers
        </p>
        <p class="p2">watching and learning from exceptional speakers offers one of the best ways to improve
            your own public speaking skills. To start, search for examples of great public speakers on
            YouTube.
            </p>
    <p class="p2">When you watch these individuals, take note of their body language. You'll find that it tends
        to remain open and inviting. They use their arms and hands in ways that accentuate their
        key points.
        </p>
        <p class="p2">Pay particular attention to how speakers pace themselves. They tend to take their time and
            deliver their words intentionally. Additionally, they use pauses to keep the audience engaged
            and do not rush themselves. They may use humor or anecdotes in appropriate and effective
            ways.</p>
    <p class="p2">To start your search, check out some of the "TED Talks" available online. Toastmasters
        International also provides examples of some of the best public speakers in the world</p>

        <p class="p3">Know Your Audience</p>
        <p class="p2">Before you give a presentation, take the time to understand your audience so that you can
            tailor your speech to them. Think about what is important to them and what they are most
            likely to find useful.</p>
            <p class="p2">The type of event where you'll be speaking will also affect your approach. A formal gala, for
                example, may require a different type of presentation than a group of your fellow students in
                a classroom setting.
                </p>
                <p class="p3">Organize Your Material</p>
    <p class="p2">Create the framework for your speech. Write down the topic, general purpose, specific
        purpose, central idea, and main points. Make sure to grab the audienceâ€™s attention in the first
        30 seconds.</p>
        <p class="p3">Start with a story</p>
        <p class="p2">Humans are wired to pay attention to stories. It activates the same parts of our brain that
            would activate if we experienced the events first-hand.
            We all respond to stories in this way. There is no difference across cultures. This means you
            can harness the power of storytelling to establish a connection with anyone.</p>


    <p class="p2">When you start your speech, you only have one minute to make a good impression on your
        audience.
        A story, anecdote, or question can pique their curiosity and make them want to keep
        listening</p>
    <p class="p3">Rehearse</p>
    <p class="p2">One of the best ways to improve your public speaking skills is simply to practice.
        Through repetition, you can iron out your messaging and find better ways to phrase certain
        parts of your presentation.
        </p>
        <p class="p2">Once you have rehearsed your speech multiple times, you will naturally feel more
            comfortable giving it in front of an audience.
            </p>
            <p class="p3">Record Your Speeches</p>
            <p class="p2">Record your public speaking performances on camera so you can go back and watch
                yourself. Examine your body language, how your voice sounds, and your pacing. Even the
                best speakers do this on a regular basis and often find ways they can improve their public
                speaking skills.
                </p>
    <p class="p2">Visualize yourself speaking confidently and the audience responding positively to your
        speech. Imagine audience members benefiting from your speech, and tell yourself that you
        are in the right place at the right time.
        </p>
        <p class="p2">Engage in eye contact and use good body language. Look your audience in the eye, and
            use facial and hand expressions. Whatever your topic, remember that your speech isn't
            boring, and you shouldn't be either.</p>
