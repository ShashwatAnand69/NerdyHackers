    <p class="p1">What is debating?</p>
    <p class="p2">A debate is a structured contest over an issue or policy. There are two sides - one
        supporting, one opposing.
        </p>
    <p class="p1">Why is debating skill important?
    </p>
    <p class="p2">Debating is very important skill whether you are in school, college or in any working place.
        There are so many benefits of this</p>
    <p class="p2">It allows you to think about aspects and perspectives you may not have considered and
        encourages you to speak strategically.
        </p>
    <p class="p2">It helps to learn how to create a persuasive argument</p>
    <p class="p2">When you have to argue against your personal view you realise that there are two sides to
        the argument.
        </p>
    <p class="p2">Debate provides experiences that are conducive to life-changing, cognitive, and
        presentational skills.</p>
    <p class="p1">How to improve debating skill?</p>
    <p class="p3">Keep Calm</p>
    <p class="p2">This is the most important rule of debating. Irrespective of whether you are debating on the
        podium or at the dining table, since the other person has a perspective that is different from
        that of your own, chances are what the other person says might offend you.
        In case such a thing does happen, make sure that you do not start shouting, swearing or
        even raising your voice</p>
    <p class="p2">Keeping your voice and body language at a moderate tone throughout the debate will make
        you appear mysterious to your opponent, thereby, making things more difficult for them.
        </p>
    <p class="p3">Act Confident</p>
    <p class="p2">This point applies not just to debating but also to life. Even if you are not confident yourself, if
        you can manage to portray yourself to look confident, half your battle is won. Any opponent
        will think twice before rebutting or cross-questioning something that has been spoken with
        confidence.
        </p>
    <p class="p3">Stay on Topic</p>
    <p class="p2">You only have a limited amount of time to state your case. If you use that time going
        off-topic, you lose valuable time. So instead, stay on topic by telling your audience your three
        points, elaborating on them further as time permits.
        </p>
    <p class="p2">Another great debating tip is adding three more points to your first three points (again, this is
        very time-dependent). This will help you stay on the topic too</p>
    <p class="p3">Maintain Proper Body Language</p>
    <p class="p2">Make sure that you maintain proper eye contact with your audience. Do not look at a
        particular section of the audience for the entire debate. This will make the rest of the
        audience feel unwanted</p>
    <p class="p2">Do not fidget with your hands. Use your hands to talk.</p>
    <p class="p2">If you are not comfortable with the idea, you can also consider keeping them pinned in front
    <p class="p2">If you are not comfortable with the idea, you can also consider keeping them pinned in front
        of you.
        </p>
    <p class="p2">Another point that is to be noted with respect to body language is the fact that you must
        stand erect and make sure that you do not lean on the podium</p>
    <p class="p3">Work On Emotions</p>
    <p class="p2">Try to tell stories and facts that will make people connect to you at a personal level.
        This tip is of utmost importance if the motion on the floor is something that is humane in
        nature (topics like euthanasia, social justice, feminism, etc.).
        </p>
    <p class="p2">Try to tell stories and facts that will make people connect to you at a personal level.
        <p class="p2">In case the motion is non-emotional in nature but you know that your opponent is someone
        who is prone to strong emotions, you can still play this card.
        </p>
    <p class="p3">Be with Topic
    </p>
    <p class="p2">Try to tell stories and facts that will make people connect to you at a personal level.
        <p class="p2">In the course of a debate it often happens that both the parties tend to deviate from the
        original idea and ultimately the conversation ends up being about something that is totally
        irrelevant. Make sure that does not happen.</p>
    <p class="p2">Try to tell stories and facts that will make people connect to you at a personal level.
        <p >Make sure that you stick to the topic. If you realise that your opponent is deviating, try to get
        them back on track. Doing so will ensure that you earn brownie points from the judges.
        </p>
    <p class="p3">Do Your Research Well</p>
    <p class="p2">Try to tell stories and facts that will make people connect to you at a personal level.
        <p class="p2">The last and perhaps the most important tip in debating is to be well-versed with what you
        are speaking on. Doing so will not only ensure that you speak well in the debate, but it will
        also put you in a position wherein you are able to answer the questions posed to you by your
        opponent.</p>
