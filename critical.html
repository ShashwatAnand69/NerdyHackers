    <p class="p1">What is critical thinking?
    </p>
    <p class="p2">Critical thinking skills help you to understand and assess a situation based on all the facts
        and information available. With the help of critical thinking skills, you can sort and organise
        information, data and facts to define and solve a problem. You probably already possess
        various critical thinking skills to discuss during interviews and include on your resume, and
        you can work to develop them.</p>
    <p class="p2">It is the process of analysing a topic or a problem deeply based on relevant information.
        Identify an issue or a problem, Understand the reason behind a problem and its solution,
        Research and collect data or information on the issue, Identify ways to refine solutions etc.
        are some common steps to improve critical thinking skills.
        </p>
    <p class="p1">Why is critical thinking skills important?</p>
    <p class="p2">By improving the quality of your thoughts and your decisions, better critical thinking skills can
        bring about a big positive change in your life. The quality of your life largely depends on the
        quality of the decisions you make.
        </p>
    <p class="p2">Amazingly, the average person makes 35,000 conscious decisions every day!
        Imagine how much better your life would be if there were a way to make the best possible
        decisions, day in and day out?
        </p>
        <p class="p3">Well, there is and it’s called critical thinking.
        </p>
        <p class="p1">How to improve critical thinking skills?
        </p>
        <p class="p3">Ask Questions</p>
    <p class="p2">One recommendation is for educators to work in-depth questioning strategies into a lesson
        launch.
        </p>
    <p class="p2">Ask thoughtful questions to the students to allow for answers with sound reasoning. Then,
        word conversations and communication to shape students’ thinking. Quick answers often
        result in very few words and no eye contact, which are skills we don’t want to promote.
        </p>
    <p class="p3">Freedom To Learn
    </p>
    <p class="p2">Give freedom to yourself to learn things; this is one of the effective ways to develop critical
        thinking skills in students. After introducing new concepts and content, you should give
        freedom to yourself to learn what you want to learn.
        </p>
    <p class="p2">This way will definitely helps you to develop critical thinking skills. When you learn the things
        of their choice, you will learn effectively. Whatever learning methods, you want or learn, or
        comfortable in learning, you should encourage yourself towards that.
        </p>
    <p class="p3">Connect different ideas</p>
        <p class="p2">Connecting different ideas is key to teaching critical thinking for teachers. For example,
            elementary school teachers can ask students if they know anyone who has to take a bus to
            work, and if so, why it would be important for that person to also have a train schedule.
            Questions like these help children consider different situations (delayed buses, for example)and potential solutions (taking the train instead), helping them apply prior knowledge to new
            contexts</p>
        <p class="p3">Connects Stories To Related Concepts</p>
        <p class="p2">Be creative as creative as you can be. try to connect stories to the related concepts for
            better understanding. Connecting stories to relatable concepts is an essential way to
            develop critical thinking. When someone understands the story’s fundamental meaning, ask
            them to draw connections outside the story by obtaining them to analyze stories that have
            the same concept.
            </p>
            <p class="p2">Also, introduce the additional texts that offer new information or concepts you can utilize to
                examine the original text. This method permits people to determine the overall importance of
                real source material.
                </p>
                <p class="p3">Try Reversing Things
                </p>
                <p class="p2">A great way to get “unstuck” on a hard problem is to try reversing things. It may seem
                    obvious that X causes Y, but what if Y caused X?
                    </p>
                    <p class="p2">The “chicken and egg problem” a classic example of this. At first, it seems obvious that the
                        chicken had to come first. The chicken lays the egg, after all. But then you quickly realize
                        that the chicken had to come from somewhere, and since chickens come from eggs, the egg
                        must have come first. Or did it?
                        Even if it turns out that the reverse isn’t true, considering it can set you on the path to finding
                        a solution.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p3">Understand That No One Thinks Critically 100% of the Time
                    </p>
                    <p class="p2">You can’t think critically all the time, and that’s okay. Critical thinking is a tool that you should
                        deploy when you need to make important decisions or solve difficult problems, but you don’t
                        need to think critically about everything.
                        And even in important matters, you will experience lapses in your reasoning. What matters is
    that you recognize these lapses and try to avoid them in the future.Even Isaac Newton, genius that he was, believed that alchemy was a legitimate pursuit</p>
