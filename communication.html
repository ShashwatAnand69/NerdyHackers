    <p class="p1">What are communication skills?</p>
    <p class="p2">Communication is an act of conveying meanings from one entity to another with the use of
understood signs, symbols and rules. Communications skills, in a nutshell, are a set of
activities you make giving and receiving various kind of information. Some of the examples
of communicating are; expressing your viewpoint on a topic, updating new additions on your
project, expressing feelings etc</p>
<p class="p2">Communication skills involve speaking, listening, observing and empathizing. It also helps to
understand how to communicate by phone conversations, face-to-face interactions, digital
communications like social media and email.</p>
<p class="p1">Why is communication skills important?</p>
<p class="p2">Have you been told several times to improve your communication skills but are struggling to
do it? Maybe you don't know where to start.
Don't worry, I've got your back (no pun intended). First of all, let me ask you a question. Is
there a particular area of your life in which you feel the lack of good communication skills is
causing challenges?</p>
<p class="p2">Or perhaps, you want to improve these soft skills so that you can excel at work and be a
more presentable employee? If so, great!
You are now aware of the importance of communication in your life - something many
people fail to see</p>
<p class="p2">The good news is that this doesn't mean that you have reached the 'end of the road' as far
as improving your communication skills is concerned. It simply means that now is the time
when you should start making small changes to your approach to communication.</p>

<p class="p1">How to improve communication skills?</p>
<p class="p3">Make eye contact</p>
<p class="p2">Whether you are speaking or listening, looking into the eyes of the person with whom you
    are conversing can make the interaction more successful. Eye contact conveys interest and
    encourages your partner to be interested in you in return.</p>
<p class="p3">Use gestures.</p>
<p class="p2">These include gestures with your hands and face. Make your whole body talk. Use smaller
    gestures for individuals and small groups. The gestures should get larger as the group that
    one is addressing increases in size.
    </p>
<p class="p3">Develop effective listening skills:</p>
<p class="p2">Not only should one be able to speak effectively, one must listen to the other person's words
    and engage in communication on what the other person is speaking about. Avoid the
    impulse to listen only for the end of their sentence so that you can blurt out the ideas or
    memories your mind while the other person is speaking.</p>
<p class="p3">Pronounce your words correctly.</p>
<p class="p2">People will judge your competency through your vocabulary. If you aren't sure of how to say
    a word, don't use it. Improve your vocabulary by reading new words in daily routine. Look in
    the dictionary to help you learn how to pronounce a new word</p>
<p class="p3">Minimize distractions</p>
<p class="p2">If you're chatting with someone (or a group) face-to-face, keep distractions at bay by leaving
    unnecessary electronic devices out of the space. Keep the attendance limited to just those
    who need to be there, and avoid scheduling at a time when people are likely to focus on
    something else (like just before the end of the day or right before lunch).</p>
<p class="p3">Don't forget to respond</p>
<p class="p2">Be sure to respond to each communication with a quick acknowledgment, even if it's an
    informal one. Although you may have received the message, it's likely that the person on the
    other end will have no way of knowing unless you let them know. A couple words or even a
    “like” will usually do the trick.</p>
