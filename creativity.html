    <p class="p1">What are innovation and creativity skills?
    </p>
    <p class="p2">Innovation is to create ideas that create value and improve processes, from inventing a
        machine to finding a faster route to work. Having innovation skills is an asset in the
        workplace because they enable you to solve problems and advance knowledge in your field.
        Investing in your own innovation skills can help you become a competitive applicant for top
        positions and promote your career success</p>
    <p class="p2">Creativity is a valuable workplace skill because it can be a useful tool for developing new
        ideas, increasing efficiency and devising solutions to complex problems. While you may
        have natural creativity skills in certain forms, it is a skill that can be learned and developed
        over time</p>
    <p class="p1">Why are creativity and innovation skills important?
    </p>
    <p class="p2">Creativity and innovation are qualities that can help professionals improve their performance
        and produce ideas that contribute to the growth of an organisation. People often use these
        terms interchangeably, but there are significant differences between them. Understanding
        these differences can help you express your creativity and create innovations in the
        workplace</p>
    <p class="p2">Being creative and innovative helps you to solve different types of problems and create
        unique solutions. Without creativity and innovation, every business would offer the same
        goods and services. They would also all use the same promotional or marketing techniques,
        making everything quite monotonous.
        </p>
    <p class="p1">How to improve creativity and innovation skills?</p>
    <p class="p3">Do what you love</p>
    <p class="p2"> This is the most important point for this section. When you actually love your job, you are
        naturally going to be more inspired and enthusiastic about creative problem solving and
        coming up with new ideas. A task that you keep putting off is going to be very difficult to
        approach with a positive, creative attitude.
        </p>
    <p class="p2">Find a hobby that lets you be creative that you love to do, such as playing an instrument,
        painting, or even a sport that completely places you in the present.
        </p>
    <p class="p3">Know your problem-solving preferences</p>
    <p class="p2">Faced with a challenge, humans naturally solve problems using a universal creative process
        that includes four distinct stages of creative thinking. In the first step, we clarify the challenge
        and generate, develop and implement ideas to resolve the challenge in the following steps.
        This universal process is, in fact, an innovation process.
        </p>
    <p class="p3">Use creative problem solving as a process for innovation
    </p>
    <p class="p2">At its essence, innovation is problems, challenges or opportunities that need creativity for
        resolution. Creativity powers our ability to overcome constraints and find the novelty and
        value necessary for innovation success.</p>
    <p class="p2">One of the best ways I've come across to develop innovation skills is to learn how to master
        the Creative Problem Solving (CPS) process. CPS is a proven method for approaching a
        problem or challenge imaginatively and innovatively. By its very nature, the CPS process
        produces ideas and options that are "creative," meaning they are novel and useful</p>
    <p class="p3">Believe in your own capability</p>
    <p class="p2">Our mind is an amazing machine and our belief system impacts on our capabilities 'to do'
        and learn. Telling ourselves that we are creative and have the capability to generate ideas,
        will ensure that we do not put any psychological barriers in the way of generating great
        ideas. The right side of our brain provides the capability to generate ideas, if we merely use
        and exercise it.</p>
    <p class="p3">Be open and willing to change.
    </p>
    <p class="p2">It's easy to envision yourself as somebody who's skilled and competent when it comes to
        innovation, but this kind of change doesn't happen overnight. It takes time and hard work.
        Improvement comes with openness, willingness, and discipline. It would be hard to improve
        your innovation skills without fully committing to it.
        </p>
    <p class="p3">Interact with creative people
    </p>
    <p class="p2">Creative people tend to have the power to see what might be and interacting with them will
        spark new ideas and ways of looking at things. Look for people who are fun to talk to and
        have a keen sense of interest in life. An individual who will force you to exercise your
        imagination, as you interact with them. Talking with a wide range of people from different
        disciplines, backgrounds, cultures and experiences will help you to see things from different
        perspectives and develop your imagination.</p>
